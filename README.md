VCS Elega Landing Page

Done with HTML, CSS and a bit of JS inside HTML.

HTML is stock, CSS is mixed. Personal CSS combined with Bootstrap grid system for mobile responsiveness. JS done for mobile navigation. CSS might show some erros, but that is due to nesting inside the CSS file. Was too lazy to convert file to SCSS and then compile it to CSS minified version. Pictures are not optimized, used their original size, so there might be some loading lag.
